Query Specifications

1. URI
	The server will receive requests in the form of <URL>/<endpoint>?<query>
	This document will discuss the query section. The endpoint can be anything, but something like "data" or "api" is suitable. All calls to this endpoint must utilize JSONP, as shown in the example code, since this will be the API for the front end.
	
2. Query
	All queries have a key=value structure, which can be extended to multiple key-value pairs with ampersands.
	The query will be parsed automatically, simply by passing it into the QueryValues class, which extends the HashMap<String, String> class. All you must worry about are what pairs there are by seeing if the QueryValue instance .contains(<key>)
	
3. Expected Queries
	In the Key section will be a literal. These never change, unless specified by us.
	In the Expected Values section will be what will be after the = sign in the query. <>s mark representations i.e. <platform>, whereas the lack thereof represents a string literal.
	The Required section denotes what other key-value pairs must be present when this query call is made. If the key-value pair is received without the other Required key-value pairs, return an error like in the example.
	The Return section will say what you must convert into a JSON object before sending it through JSONP.

	Here are some pairs we will use.
		Key			Expected Values			Required		Return
		===============================================================
		get			playlists								An array of playlists owned by the user
		
		import		<platformID>							IF the playlist key is NOT present:
																A list of playlists on the <platform> that the user can import.
															IF the playlist key IS present:
																The playlist.
															IF the playlist already exists in database:
															    IF query contains "force"
															        Error message
															    Else
															        The playlist
																
		export		<platformID>			playlist		Returns which songs were NOT successfully exported, if any, as an array.
		
		merge		<playlistIDs>			name			Merges all <playlistID>s into one playlist and names the playlist the value of the name key, returns the playlistID of the new playlist and all songs in each playlist that were lost in the merge.
															<playlistIDs> is a space-separated list of playlists e.g. "12 13 14"
		
		playlist	<playlistID>							Returns songs in list if used on its own.
		
		remove		<playlistID>							Removes the playlist from the user's database.
		
		login		login					username,		IF the login is successful
											password			return the token used to access server material for the user
															ELSE
																return a reason, e.g. "Email does not exist" or "Bad password"
																
		signup		signup					username,		IF the signup is successfuly
											password,			return the token used to access server material for the user
											email			ELSE
																return a reason, e.g. "Email taken" or "Password too short"
																
		username	<username>				password		Used with either login or signup.
		
		password	<password>				username		Used with either login or signup.

		search      <search string>                         String of result. Will eventually be spotify uri

		share       <playlistID>                            Share token string for the selected playlist

		importshare <sharetoken>                            Playlist object from token

		add         <playlistID SpotifySongID>              Result true or false
		
		One thing to note is that for many of these, an access token will also be provided. The details of this will be determined later (perhaps in sprint 2).
